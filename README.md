# BTE320-Portfolio
A portfolio for the programs created during my BTE320 Fundamentals of Python class.

## February 12th, 2024
Added the "Projects" file which contains code for various little projects. Includes a rock paper scissors game, a program which tells whether a year is a leap year, and the parking garage and movie theater problems!
\nAdded the "Deposit_with_Interest_Rates" file which contains code for a program which allows a user to see how much money they will have in their account (with interest) after a year given certain conditions.
