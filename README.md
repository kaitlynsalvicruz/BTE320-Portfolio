# BTE320-Portfolio
A portfolio for the programs created during my BTE320 Fundamentals of Python class.

Added the "Projects" file which contains code for various little projects. Includes a rock paper scissors game, a program which tells whether a year is a leap year, and the parking garage and movie theater problems!
